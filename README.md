a tool to give and receive help in a structured manner

## The gist of it
1. Define what needs you have out of 7 levels that map to each of the chakras, and if you can help in each of the levels. Toggle the corresponding selectors
2. Identify yourself in very general terms by toggling certain selectors if appropriate, so people can find you
3. Press "Start Advertising"
4. Store your phone away
5. When a match is found, your phone will notify you and you can look for the person based on the general identifying information that the other person shared, or peple may come to you based on the indenficating features you shared, and you can chat about how you can help each other based on what you have advertised
